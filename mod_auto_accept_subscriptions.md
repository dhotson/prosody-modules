# Introduction #

In some environments where all users on the system have mutual trust in each other, it's sometimes fine to skip the usual authorization process to
add someone to your contact list and see their status.

This module sets Prosody to automatically accept incoming subscription authorization requests, and add the contact to the user's contact list, without intervention from the user.

# Configuration #
Simply add the module to your modules\_enabled list like any other module:

```
	modules_enabled = {
		...
		"auto_accept_subscriptions";
		...
	}
```

This module has no further configuration.
