# Introduction #

This module pushes the users nickname and avatar from vCards into PEP, or into vCards from PEP.  This allows interop between older clients that use [XEP-0153: vCard-Based Avatars](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0153.html) to see the avatars of clients that use [XEP-0084: User Avatar](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html) and vice versa.

# Configuration #
