# Introduction #

This module allows disabling room creation based on regexp patterns defined in configuration.

# Dependencies #

This module depends on **muc/rooms** module. If **muc/rooms** is not loaded, this module won't work.

# How to load the module #

Copy the module to the prosody modules/plugins directory.

In Prosody's configuration file, under the desired MUC component definition, add:
```
  modules_enabled = {
    ...
    "mod_muc_restrict_rooms";
    ...
  }
```

**Note**: This module _shouldn't_ be loaded in the global **modules\_enabled**, otherwise it won't work.

# Configuration #

**mod\_muc\_restrict\_rooms** has several variables which let you configure the patterns for room names you want to ban, establish exceptions for those patterns and even deciding whether admins can or not bypass the prohibition.

| **Name**                  | **Description**                                      | **Example**   | **Default value**  |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:--------------|:-------------------|
| muc\_restrict\_matching   | Table in the key/value format (keys for patterns and values for reasons) that determines which rooms shouldn't be created. The key is a regexp and must be specified between quotation marks (see example). Room names will be evaluated always lowercase, so define your patterns taking this into consideration. Users that try to join any room that matches one of those rules will get an error telling them they cannot join. | muc\_restrict\_matching = { ["^admin"] = "Rooms that start with 'admin' are reserved for staff use only" } | {}                 |
| muc\_restrict\_exceptions | String format table that contains exceptions to the above defined rules. Room names specified here will bypass the muc\_restrict\_matching restrictions and will be available for anyone | muc\_restrict\_exceptions = { "admins\_are\_good", "admins\_rocks" } | {}                 |
| muc\_restrict\_allow\_admins | Boolean that determines whether users in the **admin** table are able to bypass any room restriction. If ser to _true_, they will be able to bypass those rules. | muc\_restrict\_allow\_admins = true | false              |
