# Introduction #

This module implements [XEP-0288: Bidirectional Server-to-Server Connections](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0288.html).  It allows servers to use a single connection for sending stanzas to each other, instead of two connections (one for stanzas in each direction).

Install and enable it like any other module.  It has no configuration.
