# Introduction #

Quite often when I am out and about, I'm not able to connect to Jabber. It is usually much more likely I can access my email though (whether via the web, or a mobile client).

For this reason I decided it would be extremely useful to have Jabber messages sent to me while I was offline forwarded to my email inbox.

# Usage #

Simply add "offline\_email" to your modules\_enabled list. When any user receives a message while they are offline, it will automatically be forwarded via mail to the **same** address as their Jabber ID. e.g. user1@example.com's offline messages will be forwarded to user1@example.com's email inbox.

# Configuration #

| queue\_offline\_emails | The number of seconds to buffer messages for, before they are sent as an email. The default is to send each message as it arrives. |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| smtp\_server           | Address of the SMTP server to send through. Default 'localhost' (recommended, see caveats below)                                   |
| smtp\_username         | If set, Prosody will authenticate with the SMTP server before sending (default is no authentication)                               |
| smtp\_password         | The password for the above user (default is none)                                                                                  |
| smtp\_from             | Address from which it will appear the emails came. Default is smtp\_username@smtp\_server, where smtp\_username is replaced with 'xmpp' if not set |

# Caveats/Todos/Bugs #

  * Currently SMTP sending blocks the whole server. This should not be noticable if your mail server is on the same machine as Prosody.
  * There is not (yet) any way to configure forwarding to an email address other than your JID (idea... use email address in vcard?)
  * Enable/disable this feature per user?
