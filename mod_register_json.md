# Introduction #

This module let's you activate a httpserver interface to handle data from webforms with POST and Base64 encoded JSON.

# Implementation Details #

Example Request format:

```
POST /your_register_base_url HTTP/1.1
Host: yourserveraddress.com:yourchoosenport
Content-Type: application/encoded
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

```

Where the encoded content is this (example) JSON Array:

```javascript

{"username":"usernameofchoice","password":"theuserpassword","ip":"theremoteaddroftheuser","mail":"usermail@usermaildomain.tld","auth_token":"yourauthtokenofchoice"}
```

Your form implementation needs to pass **all** parameters, the auth\_token is needed to prevent misuses, if the request is successfull the server will answer with status code 200 and with the body of the response containing the token which your web app can send via e-mail to the user to complete the registration.

Else, it will reply with the following http error codes:

  * 400 - if there's an error syntax;
  * 401 - whenever an username is already pending registration or the auth token supplied is invalid;
  * 403 - whenever registration is forbidden (blacklist, filtered mail etc.);
  * 406 - if the username supplied fails nodeprepping;
  * 409 - if the user already exists, or an user is associated already with the supplied e-mail;
  * 503 - whenever a request is throttled.

The verification URL path to direct the users to will be: **/your-base-path-of-choice/verify/** - on your Prosody's http server.

The module for now stores a hash of the user's mail address to help slow down duplicated registrations.

It's strongly encouraged to have the web server communicate with the servlet via https.

# Usage #

Copy the module folder and all its contents (register\_json) into your prosody modules' directory.
Add the module your vhost of choice modules\_enabled.

Hint: pairing with mod\_register\_redirect is helpful, to allow server registrations only via your webform.

Optional configuration directives:
```lua

reg_servlet_base = "/base-path/" -- Base path of the plugin (default is register_account)
reg_servlet_secure = true -- Have the plugin only process requests on https (default is true)
reg_servlet_ttime = seconds -- Specifies the time (in seconds) between each request coming from the same remote address.
reg_servlet_bl = { "1.2.3.4", "4.3.2.1" } -- The ip addresses in this list will be blacklisted and will not be able to submit registrations.
reg_servlet_wl = { "1.2.3.4", "4.3.2.1" } -- The ip addresses in this list will be ignored by the throttling.
reg_servlet_filtered_mails = { ".*banneddomain.tld", ".*deamailprovider.tld" } -- allows filtering of mail addresses via Lua patterns.
```
