# Introduction #

This module implements [XEP-268](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0268.html).

# Details #

It will let you manage reports, inquiries, requests and responses through an Adhoc interface.
The following new adhoc admin commands will be available:

  * List Incidents -- List all available incidents and let's you reply requests.
  * Send Incident Inquiry -- Inquiry a remote server about an incident.
  * Send Incident Report -- Send an incident report to a remote server.
  * Send Incident Request -- Send an incident request to a remote server.

Each Adhoc form provides syntax instructions through `<desc/>` elements (they may currently be stripped
by Prosody), although it's encouraged to read the [IODEF specifications](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070).

# Usage #

Copy the module folder into your prosody modules directory.
Place the module between your enabled modules either into the global or a vhost section.

Optional configuration directives:
```lua

incidents_expire_time = 86400 -- Expiral of "closed" incidents in seconds.
```
