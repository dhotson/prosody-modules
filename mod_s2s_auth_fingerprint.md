# Introduction #

This module allows you to manually pin certificate fingerprints of remote servers.

# Details #

Servers not listed in the configuration are not affected.

# Configuration #

After installing and enabling this module, you can put fingerprints of remote servers in your config like this:

```
s2s_auth_fingerprint_digest = "sha1" -- This is the default. Other options are "sha256" and "sha512"
s2s_trusted_fingerprints = {
	["jabber.org"] = "11:C2:3D:87:3F:95:F8:13:F8:CA:81:33:71:36:A7:00:E0:01:95:ED";
	["matthewwild.co.uk"] = {
		"FD:7F:B2:B9:4C:C4:CB:E2:E7:48:FB:0D:98:11:C7:D8:4D:2A:62:AA";
		"CF:F3:EC:43:A9:D5:D1:4D:D4:57:09:55:52:BC:5D:73:06:1A:A1:A0";
	};
}

-- If you don't want to fall back to dialback, you can list the domains s2s_secure_domains too
s2s_secure_domains = {
	"jabber.org";
}
```
