# Introduction #

By default Prosody does not reload modules at runtime unless instructed to via one of its admin interfaces. However sometimes you want to easily reload a module to apply new settings when the config changes.

mod\_reload\_modules will reload a set list of modules every time Prosody reloads its config (e.g. on SIGHUP).

# Configuration #

Add "reload\_modules" to modules\_enabled. Then the list of modules to reload using the 'reload\_modules' option in your config like so:

```
    reload_modules = { "groups", "tls" }
```

This would reload mod\_groups and mod\_tls whenever the config is reloaded. Note that on many systems this will be at least daily, due to logrotate.
