# Introduction #

mod\_motd\_sequential is a variant of
[mod\_motd](https://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_motd) that lets you specify
a sequence of MOTD messages instead of a single static one.  Each message
is only sent once and the module keeps track of who as seen which message.

# Configuration #

```

	modules_enabled = {
		-- other modules
			"motd_sequential";
	}
	motd_sequential_messages = {
		"Hello and welcome to our service!", -- First login
		"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", -- Second time they login
		-- Add more messages here.
	}

```
