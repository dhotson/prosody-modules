# Introduction #

This module allows you to perform various actions on user rosters via prosodyctl.

# Details #

After putting this module in your modules directory you can use it via prosodyctl like this:

```
    prosodyctl mod_roster_command COMMAND [OPTIONS...]
```

**Note:** Do not add mod\_roster\_command to your Prosody config file. This is unnecessary because it will automatically be loaded by prosodyctl when you use it.

## Commands ##

```
    subscribe user@host contact@host
```

Subscribes the user to the contact's presence. That is, the user will see when the contact is online (but the contact won't see the user).

```
    subscribe_both user@host contact@host
```
The same as the 'subscribe' command, but performs the subscription in both directions, so that both the contact and user will always see each other online.

```
    unsubscribe user@host contact@host
```

Removes a subscription to the contact's presence.

```
    unsubscribe_both user@host contact@host
```

Same as unsubscribe, but also revokes a contact's subscription to the user's presence.

```
    rename user@host contact@host [name] [group]
```

Sets or updates a name for a contact in the user's roster, and moves the contact to the given group, if specified.
