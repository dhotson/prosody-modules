# Introduction #

It is possible for the user to supply more than just a username and password when creating an account using [mod\_register](https://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_register). This module automatically copies over that data to the user's vcard.

# Details #

There is no configuration for this module, just add it to modules\_enabled as normal.

Note that running this on a public-facing server that prompts for email during registration will make the user's email address publicly visible in their vcard.
