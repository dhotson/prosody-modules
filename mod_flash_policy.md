# Introduction #

This Prosody plugin adds support for flash socket policies. When connecting with a flash client (from a webpage, not an exe) to prosody the flash client requests for an xml "file" on port 584 or the connecting port (5222 in the case of default xmpp). Responding on port 584 is tricky because it requires root priviliges to set up a socket on a port < 1024.

This plugins filters the incomming data from the flash client. So when the client connects with prosody it immediately sends a xml request string (`<policy-file-request/>\0`). Prosody responds with a flash cross-domain-policy. See http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/socket_policy_files.html for more information.

# Usage #

Add "flash\_policy" to your modules\_enabled list.

# Configuration #

| crossdomain\_file | Optional. The path to a file containing an cross-domain-policy in xml format. |
|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| crossdomain\_string | Optional. A cross-domain-policy as string. Should include the xml declaration. |

Both configuration options are optional. If both are not specified a cross-domain-policy with "`<allow-access-from domain="*" />`" is used as default.

# Caveats/Todos/Bugs #

  * The assumption is made that the first packet received will always
contain the policy request data, and all of it. This isn't robust
against fragmentation, but on the other hand I highly doubt you'll be
seeing that with such a small packet.
  * Only tested by me on a single server :)
