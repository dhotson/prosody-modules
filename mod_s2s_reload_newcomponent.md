# Introduction #

Currently, module:reload command in console doesn't load new components. This module will automatically load the new components (if any) when the config:reload command is run in the console.


# Details #

In order to use the plugin, simply load the plugin by adding "s2s\_reload\_newcomponent" to the modules enabled list. The plugin requires configuration to be reloaded via console plugin's config:reload() command.

Now, add a new component in the prosody configuration and then run config:reload() command in the console plugin. The new component should become active in prosody at this point and can be used.

# Dependency #

Needs console plugin to reload configuration.
