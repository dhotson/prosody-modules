# Introduction #

Twitter has simple API to use, so I tried to deal with it via Prosody.
I didn't manage to finish this module, but it is nice example of component that accepts registrations, unregistrations, does HTTP polling and so on.
Maybe someone will finnish this idea.

# Details #

It does require some non-prosody Lua libraries: LuaJSON


# Configuration #

At the moment no configuration needed, but you can configure some variables inside code.

# TODO #

  * Send latest tweets to XMPP user
  * Reply user's messages to Twitter
  * OAuth support
  * User configuration (forms)
  * discuss about using cjson
  * [!!!!] rewrite to be compatible with 0.9+
  * drop? (since it is mod\_twitter in spectrum)

# Compatibility #
