# Introduction #

This module produces info level log messages with the certificate status
and fingerprint every time an s2s connection is established.  It can also
optionally store this in persistant storage.

**info** jabber.org has a trusted valid certificate with SHA1: 11:C2:3D:87:3F:95:F8:13:F8:CA:81:33:71:36:A7:00:E0:01:95:ED

Fingerprints could then be added to [mod\_s2s\_auth\_fingerprint](mod_s2s_auth_fingerprint.md).

# Configuration #

Add the module to the `modules_enabled` list.

```
modules_enabled = {
	...
	"s2s_log_certs";
}
```

If you want to keep track of how many times, and when a certificate is seen add

`s2s_log_certs_persist = true`
