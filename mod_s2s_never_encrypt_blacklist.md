# Details #

Let's you stop Prosody from sending 

&lt;starttls xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls'&gt;

 feature to choppy/buggy servers which therefore would fail to re-negotiate and use a secure stream. (e.g. [OpenFire 3.7.0](http://issues.igniterealtime.org/browse/OF-405))

# Usage #

Copy the plugin into your prosody's modules directory.

And add it between your enabled modules into the global section (modules\_enabled).

Then list each host as follow:
```
tls_s2s_blacklist = { "host1.tld", "host2.tld", "host3.tld" }
```

In the unfortunate case of OpenFire... you can add the Server's ip address directly as it may not send proper rfc6121 requests.
```
tls_s2s_blacklist_ip = { "a.a.a.a", "b.b.b.b", "c.c.c.c" }
```

# Compatibility #

It's supposed to work with 0.7-0.8.x
