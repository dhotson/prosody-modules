# Introduction #

This module acts as a normal storage module for Prosody, but saves all data in memory only. All data is lost when the server stops. This makes it useful for testing, or certain specialized applications.

# Details #

Because the accounts store will always begin empty, it is mostly useful combined with an authentication plugin which doesn't use Prosody's storage API, or with [mod\_auth\_any](mod_auth_any.md), or you can create user accounts manually each time the server starts.
