# Introduction #

This module fetches the current status of configured hosts and/or stanza statistics from [mod\_stanza\_counter](http://code.google.com/p/prosody-modules/wiki/mod_stanza_counter#).
And outputs it in either XML or JSON format.

# Usage #

Copy the file into prosody's module directory and place it into your global's enabled modules.

Configuration example:
```
server_status_basepath = "/server-info/"
server_status_show_hosts = { "iwanttoshowifthishostisonline.com", "iwanttoshowifthishostisonline2.com" }
server_status_show_comps = { "muc.iwanttoshowifthishostisonline.com", "transport.iwanttoshowifthishostisonline.com" }
server_status_json = true
```

By default the plugin's output is in XML, setting server\_status\_json to "true" will turn it into JSON instead.
if mod\_stanza\_counter isn't loaded the plugin will require at least either server\_status\_show\_hosts or server\_status\_show\_comps to be set.

# Info #
