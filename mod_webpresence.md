# Introduction #

Quite often you may want to publish your Jabber status to your blog or website. mod\_webpresence allows you to do exactly this.

# Details #

This module uses Prosody's built-in HTTP server (it does not depend on mod\_httpserver). It supplies a status icon representative of a user's online state.

# Installation #

Simply copy mod\_webpresence.lua to your modules directory, the image files are embedded within it. Then add "webpresence" to your modules\_enabled list.

# Usage #

Once loaded you can embed the icon into a page using a simple `<img>` tag, as follows:

`<img src="http://prosody.example.com:5280/status/john.smith" />`

Alternatively, it can be used to get status name as plaint text, status message as plain text or html-code for embedding on web-pages.

To get status name in plain text you can use something like that link: `http://prosody.example.com:5280/status/john.smith/text`

To get status message as plain text you can use something like following link: `http://prosody.example.com:5280/status/john.smith/message`

To get html code, containig status name, status image and status message  (if set):
`http://prosody.example.com:5280/status/john.smith/html`
