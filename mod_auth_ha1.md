# Introduction #

This module authenticates users against hashed credentials stored in a plain text file. The format is the same as that used by reTurnServer.

# Configuration #

| **Name** | **Default** | **Description** |
|:---------|:------------|:----------------|
| auth\_ha1\_file | auth.txt    | Path to the authentication file|

Prosody reads the auth file at startup and on reload (e.g. SIGHUP).

# File Format #

The file format is text, with one user per line. Each line is broken into four fields separated by colons (':'):

```
username:ha1:host:status
```

| **Field** | **Description** |
|:----------|:----------------|
|username   |The user's login name|
|ha1        |An MD5 hash of "username:host:password"|
|host       |The XMPP hostname|
|status     |The status of the account. Prosody expects this to be just the text "authorized"|

## Example ##

```
john:2a236a1a68765361c64da3b502d4e71c:example.com:authorized
mary:4ed7cf9cbe81e02dbfb814de6f84edf1:example.com:authorized
charlie:83002e42eb4515ec0070489339f2114c:example.org:authorized
```

Constructing the hashes can be done manually using any MD5 utility, such as md5sum. For example the user 'john' has the password 'hunter2', and his hash can be calculated like this:

```
echo -n "john:example.com:hunter2" | md5sum -
```
