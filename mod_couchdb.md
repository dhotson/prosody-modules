_**Note:** This module needs updating to the 0.8 storage module API._

# Introduction #

This is an experimental Prosody backend for CouchDB.

# Configuration #
In your config file, under the relevant host, add:
```
datastore = "couchdb";
couchdb_url = "http://127.0.0.1:5984/database-name";
```

# Compatibility #

This module was developed as a prototype during development of the storage provider API in Prosody 0.8. The final storage provider API is different, so this module needs updates to work.

# Quirks #

This implementation is a work in progress.

  * The data stored in couchdb is limited to: account data, rosters, private XML and vCards
