# Introduction #

This module largely duplicates the functionality of the standard mod\_announce that is included with Prosody. It was developed for compatibility with some clients (e.g. iChat) that do not support ad-hoc commands or sending to JIDs with the format 'example.com/announce/online'.

It may also be useful in other specific cases.

# Configuration #

```
Component "broadcast@example.com" "broadcast"
```

By default, only server admins are allowed to post to this address. You can override this, by specifying the 'broadcast\_senders' option:

```
Component "broadcast@example.com" "broadcast"
    broadcast_senders = { "user1@example.com", "user2@example.com" }
```
