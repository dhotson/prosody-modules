# Introduction #

Prosody-captcha is a little modification of prosody's "mod\_register.lua" module that provides captcha protection for registration form.

# Installation #
First of all you should build and install lua bindings for libgd — [lua-gd](https://github.com/ittner/lua-gd/).

Then clone repsository lua-captcha:

**` $ git clone https://github.com/mrDoctorWho/lua-captcha `**

install it:

**` $ make install `**

# Configuration #

After that you would configure prosody. This module requires from you 4 fields, you should add this into your VirtualHost entry.

```
captcha_config = {
        dir = "/tmp"; -- Directory used to storage captcha images. Please make sure prosody user allowed to write there.
        timeout = 60; -- Timeout when captcha will expire
        web_path = "challenge"; -- Web path used to separate main prosody site from itself modules.
        font = "/usr/lib/prosody/FiraSans-Regular.ttf" -- Font used for captcha text
}
```

You can run script "install.lua" to install this or instead of that while prosody developers didn't accepted "dataforms" changes you should replace standard prosody "dataforms.lua" located in ubuntu in /usr/lib/prosody/util by another one from this repository. You should do the same thing with "mod\_register.lua" located in ubuntu in /usr/lib/prosody/modules.

After this all you can try to register on your server and see the captcha.

# TODO #
  * Maybe use recaptcha instead of libgd.
