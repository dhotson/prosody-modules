# Introduction #

[OTR, "Off The Record"](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/), encryption allows clients to encrypt messages such that the server cannot read/modify them.

This module allows the server admin to require that all messages are OTR-encrypted.

# Configuration #

Just enable the module by adding it to your global `modules_enabled`, or if you only want to load it on a single host you can load it only for one host like this:

```
VirtualHost "example.com"
    modules_enabled = { "require_otr" }
```
