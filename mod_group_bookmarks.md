# Introduction #

[mod\_groups](http://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_groups) allows you to insert contacts into users' contact lists. Well mod\_group\_bookmarks allows you to insert chatrooms into the user's bookmarks. These are fetched by their client and automatically joined when the log in.

In short, if you want to automatically join users to rooms when they sign in, this is the module you want.

# Details #

Most clients support storing a private list of room "bookmarks" on the server. When they log in, they fetch this list and join any that are marked as "autojoin". Without affecting normal usage of the bookmarks store this module dynamically inserts custom rooms into users' bookmarks lists.

# Usage #

Similar to [mod\_groups](http://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_groups), you need to make a text file in this format:

```
[room@conferenceserver]
user1@example.com=User 1
user2@example.com=User 2

[otherroom@conferenceserver]
user3@example.net=User 3
```

Add "group\_bookmarks" to your modules\_enabled list:
```
    modules_enabled = {
               -- ...other modules here... --
               "group_bookmarks";
               -- ...maybe some more here... --
    }
```

# Configuration #
|group\_bookmarks\_file|The path to the text file you created (as above).|
|:---------------------|:------------------------------------------------|

# Compatibility #

# Todo #

  * Support for injecting into ALL users bookmarks, without needing a list
  * Allow turning off the autojoin flag
  * Perhaps support a friendly name for the bookmark (currently uses the room address)
