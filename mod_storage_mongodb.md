# Introduction #

This is a storage backend that uses MongoDB.
Depends on [luamongo bindings](https://github.com/mwild1/luamongo)

This module is not under active development and has a number of issues related to limitations in MongoDB. It is not suitable for production use.

In Prosody's configuration file, set:
```
    storage = "mongodb"
```
