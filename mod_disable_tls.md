# Introduction #

This module can be used to prevent Prosody from offering TLS on client ports that you specify. This can be useful to work around buggy clients when transport security is not required.

# Configuration #

Load the module, and set `disable_tls_ports` to a list of ports:

```
    disable_tls_ports = { 5322 }
```

Don't forget to add any extra ports to c2s\_ports, so that Prosody is actually listening for connections!
