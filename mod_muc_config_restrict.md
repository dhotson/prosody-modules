# Introduction #

Sometimes, especially on public services, you may want to allow people to create their own rooms, but prevent some options from being modified by normal users.

For example, using this module you can prevent users from making rooms persistent, or making rooms publicly visible.

# Details #

You need to supply a list of options that will be restricted to admins. Available options can vary, but the following table lists Prosody's built-in options (as defined in XEP-0045):

| **Name** | **Description** |
|:---------|:----------------|
| muc#roomconfig\_roomname | The title/name of the room |
| muc#roomconfig\_roomdesc | The description of the room |
| muc#roomconfig\_persistentroom | Whether the room should remain when empty |
| muc#roomconfig\_publicroom | Whether the room is publicly visible |
| muc#roomconfig\_changesubject | Whether occupants can change the subject |
| muc#roomconfig\_whois | Control who can see occupant's real JIDs |
| muc#roomconfig\_roomsecret | The room password |
| muc#roomconfig\_moderatedroom | Whether the room is moderated |
| muc#roomconfig\_membersonly | Whether the room is members-only |
| muc#roomconfig\_historylength | The length of the room history |

Some plugins may add other options to the room config (in Prosody 0.10+), for which you will need to consult their documentation for the full option name.

# Configuration #

Enable the plugin on a MUC host (do not put it in your global modules\_enabled list):

```
    Component "conference.example.com" "muc"
        modules_enabled = { "muc_config_restrict" }
        muc_config_restricted = {
            "muc#roomconfig_persistentroom"; -- Prevent non-admins from changing a room's persistence setting
            "muc#roomconfig_membersonly"; -- Prevent non-admins from changing whether rooms are members-only
        }
```
