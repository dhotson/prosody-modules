# Introduction #

This module intercepts messages between users and into chatrooms, and attaches a links to a rendered version of any [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) in the message. This requires client support for [XHTML-IM](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html), and fetching images via HTTP.

This module was tested with the [Gajim](http://gajim.org/) client.

# Details #

There is no configuration (yet). The module uses [MathTran](http://www.mathtran.org/) to render the LaTeX.

# Todo #
  * Support for other rendering services (easy)
  * Provide a built-in rendering service (e.g. mimetex)
  * Send the images inline over XMPP (little client support at the moment)
