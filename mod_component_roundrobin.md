# Introduction #

This module enables multiple instances of external components to connect at the same time, and does round-robin load-balancing of incoming stanzas.

# Example #

```
	Component "test.example.com"
		modules_enabled = { "component_roundrobin" }
		-- Other component options such as secrets here
```
