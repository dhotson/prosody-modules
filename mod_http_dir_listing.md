# Introduction #

This module generates directory listings when invoked by `mod_http_files`.
See [documentation on `mod\_http\_files`](http://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_http_files).

# Configuration #

The module itself doesn't have any configuration of its own, just enable the it along with `mod_http_files`.

```
modules_enabled = {
	...

	"http_files";
	"http_dir_listing";
}

http_dir_listing = true;
```

The layout, CSS and icons in the `resources/` directory can be customized
or replaced.  All resources are cached in memory when the module is
loaded and the images are inlined in the CSS.
