# Quirks #

This implementation is a work in progress.

  * Stanzas to full JIDs get sifted correctly
  * Stanzas to bare JIDs are currently allowed/disallowed for all resources as a whole, and not for individual resources
  * Presence is only sent to available resources, and probes are not sent for unavailable reasources
  * This module currently does not interact with offline messages (filtered messages are dropped with an error reply)
  * Not tested with privacy lists
