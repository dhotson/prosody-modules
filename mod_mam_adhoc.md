# Introduction #

This module complements mod\_mam by allowing clients to change archiving preferences through an Ad-hoc command.

# Details #

When enabled, an "Archive Settings" command should appear in the list of Ad-hoc commands available.  This allows the user to change default policy (always, never, roster) and which JIDs to always store or never store.

# Usage #

First copy the module to the prosody plugins directory.

Then add "mam\_adhoc" to your modules\_enabled list:
```
    modules_enabled = {
                    -- ...
                    "mam",
                    "mam_adhoc",
                    -- ...
		}
```
