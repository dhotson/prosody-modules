# Introduction #

In some environments it is desirable to isolate one or more hosts, and prevent communication with external, or even other internal domains.

Loading mod\_isolate\_host on a host will prevent all communication with JIDs outside of the current domain, though it is possible to configure exceptions.

**Note:** if you just want to prevent communication with external domains, this is possible without a plugin. See [Prosody: Disabling s2s](http://prosody.im/doc/s2s#disabling) for more information.

# Configuration #

To isolate all hosts by default, add the module to your global modules\_enabled:

```
    modules_enabled = {
        ...
        "isolate_host";
        ...
    }
```

Alternatively you can isolate a single host by putting a modules\_enabled line under the VirtualHost directive:

```
    VirtualHost "example.com"
        modules_enabled = { "isolate_host" }
```

After enabling the module, you can add further options to add exceptions for the isolation:

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| isolate\_except\_domains | A list of domains to allow communication with. |
| isolate\_except\_users | A list of user JIDs allowed to bypass the isolation and communicate with other domains. |

**Note:** Admins of hosts are always allowed to communicate with other domains
