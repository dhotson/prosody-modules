# Introduction #

This module is used by other modules to access an LDAP server.  It's pretty useless on its own; you should use it if you want to write your own LDAP-related module, or if you want to use one of mine ([mod\_auth\_ldap2](mod_auth_ldap2.md), [mod\_storage\_ldap](mod_storage_ldap.md)).

# Installation #

Simply copy ldap.lib.lua into your Prosody installation's plugins directory.

# Configuration #

Configuration for this module (and all modules that use it) goes into the _ldap_ section of your prosody.cfg.lua file.  Each plugin that uses it may add their own sections; this plugin relies on the following keys:

  * hostname - Where your LDAP server is located
  * bind\_dn  - The DN to perform queries as
  * bind\_password - The password to use for queries
  * use\_tls - Whether or not TLS should be used to connect to the LDAP server
  * user.usernamefield - The LDAP field that contains a user's username
  * user.basedn - The base DN for user records

# API #

## ldap.getconnection() ##

Returns an LDAP connection object corresponding to the configuration in prosody.cfg.lua.  The connection object is a [LuaLDAP](http://www.keplerproject.org/lualdap/) connection.

## ldap.getparams() ##

Returns the LDAP configuration provided in prosody.cfg.lua.  Use this if you want to stick some configuration information for your module into the LDAP section in the configuration file.

## ldap.bind(username, password) ##

Verifies that _username_ and _password_ bind ok.  **NOTE**: This does not bind the current LDAP connection to the given username!

## ldap.singlematch(query) ##

Used to fetch a single LDAP record given an LDAP query.  A convenience function.

## ldap.filter.combine\_and(...) ##

Takes a list of LDAP filter expressions and returns a filter expression that results in the intersection of each given expression (it ANDs them together).
